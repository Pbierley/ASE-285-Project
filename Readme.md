# Project Description
Build a lightweight **ChatGPT mock** — a single-page app that demonstrates a chat-based UI with AI-generated replies, multi-session support, and persisted conversation history.  
Target audience: students/developers who want a simple local demo of chat UX + AI integration.

Many learners and teams want a sandboxed way to experiment with conversational UIs and AI without deploying a heavy backend.  
The app focuses on:
- Easy creation and switching of chat sessions
- Multiple conversations per session (topic-based)
- Fast local persistence so users can continue where they left off
